### Android Implementation
Class ```connectSQL``` is implemented with necessary credentials included. It connects to MySQL database and fetch requested records from it in a new thread, so that no front-end operations are blocked.

#### Usage:

in ```onCreate```:
```
connectSQL sql = new connectSQL(); //instantiate sql object
sql.execute("SQL query here") //for instance, sql.execute("SELECT * FROM people")ï¼›
```

in ```onPostExecute```, records returned are stored in ```List<Map<String, String>> result``` param, which is an arraylist containing multiple maps. You might want to implement what to do with records returned in this callback function.

Use ```result.get(index)``` to find certain row, and use ```result.get(index).get(column_name) ```to further navigate to certain attribute.
